# Keepass-NG
Keepass-NG is currently in pre-alpha and should not be used for anything.

The goal is to provide a password-manager that can serve as a replacement for keepass2, 
which doesn't quite fit my workflow.

As well I want to experiment with electron.atom, es6 and web-components :)

## TODO
- move to es6 and web-components
- add search functionality
- autocomplete for search
- make search available via global shortcut
- automatically type into passwd-fields (p.e. using xdotools?) 


## Code inspired by:
- https://github.com/gesellix/keepass-node


## dependencies
On linux, for better performance:
sudo apt-get install libcrypto++-dev
